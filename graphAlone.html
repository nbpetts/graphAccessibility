                                The graph shows that from 2000 to 2015, the percentage of American adults that use broadband has increased greatly. However, in the most recent years, the increase has leveled off. The authors of this graph are John B. Horrigan and Maeve Duggan with Pew
                                Research Center. The dataset is derived from Pew Research Center surveys. The sample size of the dataset is 2,001 American adults. The graph is used to show that the percentage of Americans with broadband at home has plateaued.

                                This graph is a line graph. The y-axis plots the percentages of U.S. adults who are home broadband users and ranges from 0% to 80% The x-axis plots each year from 2000 to 2015. There is a single line that connects each of the 16 data points. The line
                                starts on the left lower corner of the graph and moves across diagonally to the upper right corner of the graph, steadily increasing at each data point between 2000 and 2009. After 2009, the line makes smaller increases
                                until 2012. There is a sharp increase between 2012 and 2013 and a slight decrease between 2013 and 2015.

                                Overall there is an increase in percentage of home broadband users from 2000 to 2015. The increase from 2009 to 2015 is not as sharp as the increase from 2000 through 2009. The percentage of home broadband users remained the same from 2013 to 2014 at
                                70%. The percentage of home broadband users decreased twice: from 66% in 2010 to 62% in 2011 and from 70% in 2014 to 67% in 2015
