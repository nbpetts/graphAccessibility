                <p>Close to half of all Americans own a tablet. The share of Americans who own a tablet computer has risen tenfold since 2010. Today, 45% of U.S. adults own a tablet â€“ a substantial increase since Pew Research Center began measuring tablet ownership in 2010. Then, only 4% of adults in the U.S. were tablet owners. Ownership, however, is statistically the same as it was in 2014.

                <p>
                  Tablet ownership varies across a number of demographic groups. Younger adults and those from more affluent backgrounds are more likely to own the devices, and differences tied to educational attainment are particularly pronounced: 62% of college graduates have a tablet, compared with 35% of those with a high school diploma and 19% who have not completed high school. Additionally, whites are more likely than Hispanics to own a tablet computer, while tablet ownership among blacks is not statistically different from that of whites or Hispanics.

                                This line graph shows the percentage of American adults over 18 who own a tablet computer from 2010 to 2015. The percentage of adults who own a tablet computer begins at 4% in 2010 and steadily increases to 45% in 2015. The author of the graph is Monica Anderson with the Pew Research Center. The most recent data in the graph derives from a Pew Research Center survey that was conducted from march 17 to April 12, 2015. The sample size of the dataset is 1,907 American adults.

                                This is a line graph. The y-axis plots the percentages of U.S. adults that own a tablet computer. The y-axis starts from the bottom at 0% and ends on the top at 50% The x-axis plots each year from 2010 to 2015. There is a single line that connects each of the 6 data points. The line starts on the left lower corner of the graph and moves across diagonally towards the upper right, increasing at each data point.
