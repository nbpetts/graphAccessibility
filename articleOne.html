                <p>For many teens, texting is the dominant way that they communicate on a day-to-day basis with their friends. Some 88% of teens text their friends at least occasionally, and fully 55% do so daily. Along with texting, teens are incorporating a number of other devices, communication platforms and online venues into their interactions with friends.

                        This bar graph presented by the Pew Research Center, shows the percentage of US teens who interact with friends every day using various methods including text messaging and in person. The graph shows that on a daily basis, the highest percentage of U.S. teens interact with friends via text messaging while the lowest percentage of US teens interact with friends via e-mail. The author of this graph and article is Amanda Lenhart with the Pew Research Center. The dataset used to create this graph comes from the Pew Research Center Teens Relationships Survey conducted between September 25 to October 9, 2014 and between February 10 to March 16, 2015. The sample size for this survey is 1,060. The graph is used to explain that text messaging is a key component of day-to-day friend interactions because it shows that 55% of teens spend time every day texting with friends

                      This is a bar graph. There are nine bars that are arranged from top to bottom along the y-axis on the left side and stretch across horizontally to the right side. The y-axis labels each bar from top to bottom as a different method that teens use to spend time with their friends. The x-axis plots the percentage of teens that use each method with friends starting from 0% and ending at 96%. Each bar is divided into three categories horizontally which  indicate the frequency for each method: every day, every few days, and less often. Each category is labeled with a percentage, and the methodâ€™s total percentage is represented by the length of the bar and the order on the y-axis from top to bottom. The bar at the top of the y-axis represents the method that teens use the most often to spend time with their friends in total, and the bottom bar represents the method that is used least often method.
